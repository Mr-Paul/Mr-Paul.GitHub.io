                            <p>River's Edge was founded with the intention of bring all the people of Rustifac together. Whether making a permanent residence, trading at the various businesses, or to visit and meet other people, River's Edge will be a welcoming place for everyone. No reasonable faction will be declined entry and has the right to purchase a home or shop. We only ask that our town be treated as a sanctuary so that the people may go about their business in peace.</p>
                            <p>If River's Edge sounds like a place you'd like to reside or maintain a store, you can purchase a space from a town official at the standard rate.</p>
